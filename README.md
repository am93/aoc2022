# 🎄 Advent of Code 2022 solutions 🎄

This repository contains my solutions for AoC 2022 written in **Python** 🐍 I kindly ask all visitors ***not to judge*** code quality or maintainability, due to the following reason:
- it is a time oriented competition ⏰ - meaning just find the solution to the problem ASAP,
- I tend to overcomplicate solutions with list comprehensions and functional programming approach
  - most of the time, there is an easier solution available, but I like to sharpen my functional approach 😇

Thanks for stopping by 👋 If you like any of the solutions drop a ⭐ to this repository.
